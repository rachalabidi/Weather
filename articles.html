                    <h1>Blizzard</h1>
                    <p>Winter is one of the most beautiful seasons in the world for many people,and this 
                    season is usually characterized by a decrease in temperature and the precipitation of larger amounts of rainwater, and with lower temperatures in the winter, snowfall becomes available in many regions of the world, and snow falls when the temperature drops the atmosphere below zero, which causes some changes to the human lifestyle in the snowfall areas, causing some injuries in snowy conditions, which calls for identifying the most important ways to prevent injuries in snowy conditions, and in this article, we will Take some ways to prevent injuries in snowy conditions:
                    <br>- Stay away from roads where snow accumulates to avoid slipping, especially for those who drive in snowy conditions.
                    <br>- Stay home during a blizzard and only go out when absolutely necessary.
                    <br>- Take all safe measures to generate electrical power in case of interruption from homes, and perform periodic maintenance of electrical generators, and place them in safe places away from home windows.
                    <br>- Equip the house with safety devices, fire detectors, and insulation systems that prevent water or gas from entering the house.</p>

                       <h1>Flood</h1>
                         <p>Algeria has experienced devastating floods in the past that caused extensive damage.They are regularly affected by these natural disasters, the effects of which are exacerbated by other factors that exacerbate them. 
                         These dramatic events, with exorbitant outcomes, are not always associated with exceptional climatic situations and occur after seasonal Ra in episodes and are not exceptional. The main event is the floods that affected the Bab El-Oued region (Algeria) on November 10, 2001 which caused one of the most unique and worst crises that resulted in the deaths of more than 800 people, 150 people missing, and the displacement of 30,000 people, in addition to net damage An economic value of more than 250 million euros.
                         It causes significant psychological trauma. The second significant flood, in and around the Algerian oasis of Ghardaia on October 2, 2008, caused by torrential rains killed at least 33 people, injured 50 others and displaced nearly 2,000 families. Several other flood events were recorded in several Algerian cities. 
                         This flood event is often described as rapidly developing events that leave little time for people to take action to minimize damage so we will give some tips for dealing with the situation:
                         <br>- Green roofs/rooftop gardens.
                         <br>- Create flood plains and overflow areas for rivers
                         <br>- Separating rainwater from the sewer system
                         <br>- Install water infiltration and attenuation systems
                         <br>- Keep the sewer system clean, so it can do its job
                         <br>- Hope for the best, but plan or the worst
                         <br>- Improve flood warning mechanisms
                         We can't just leave it up to the government, municipalities, environmentalists or urban planners to put an infrastructure in place to prevent urban flooding. We each of us must make it our personal responsibility to adapt to climate change. Whether it's collecting rainwater or building a garden on top of our roofs, it's imperative that we take the steps necessary to be part of the rainwater management solution.</p>

            <h1>Hurricanes</h1>
            <p>At least 337 people were killed and hundreds were injured when a 36-hour hurricanes pounded the northern part of Algeria in Mon, Nov 12, 2001.
            Hurricanes are dangerous and can cause severe damage due to storm surges, wind damage, rip currents, and floods. It can occur along any coast in Algeria .And the hazards of hurricanes are numerous and dangerous. Usually, residents have just a few days’ warning before the storm hits, bringing with it heavy rain, flooding, high winds, storm surges (when the storm pushes sea water inland), and possibly even tornadoes.Making protective home upgrades is key to preventing or reducing damage from happening to your property, and protecting your family. There are a number of natural disaster preparation projects ideal for homes that experience occasional to frequent storms:
            <br>-When a hurricane warning is issued, rush to the nearest store. As much as possible, keep the following things close at hand : Extra batteries,Candles or lamps with fuel,Matches,Materials and tools for emergency home repairs–such as heavy plastic sheeting, plywood, a hammer...,Food that you don’t have to refrigerate or cook,First aid supplies,A portable NOAA weather radio,A wrench and other basic tools.
            <br>-Some of these helpful storm protection upgrades include installing impact-resistant doors, hurricane shutters, roof braces, and water barriers (where flooding is a concern).
            <br>-The term “impact resistant" refers to shutters, windows, and doors that have been proven to resist the impact from large windborne debris. The strongest impact-resistant windows are capable of withstanding storm winds of up to 200 miles per hour. While impact-resistant windows and doors are more expensive, some insurance companies offer substantial premium discounts. Plus, they will save on utilities with better insulated homes.
            <br>Severe storms drain electrical power, making it unavailable for days, weeks, and even months on end. Having a backup generator ensures you get power, even after the fiercest storm.

            <h1>Drought</h1>
            <p>Algeria is known for its multi-year droughts. Long-lasting below normal rainfall in a semi-arid climate has devastating impacts on Algerian agriculture.
            Drought is a relative phenomenon meaning that it is a deviation from normal hydrometeorological conditions. It deviates from aridity, which is a permanent feature of a dry climate (in this study low average rainfall), and is not water scarcity (long-term unsustainable use of water resources).Drought causes great difficulty due to lack of water for drinking, cleaning and irrigation of crops. If you live in a drought-prone area, it will be helpful to take some steps to ensure that you and your community are as prepared as possible in the event of a drought.
            Serious droughts can result in water shortages that could last weeks or months. With proper rationing and conservation, however, you and your household can hold out for several weeks on stored drinking water. If you live in a drought-prone area, it would be a good idea to have a plan in place for what you'll do in the event of a drought. By drawing up a plan, you and your family can be prepared for when a drought does hit:
            <br>-Make sure everyone in your house knows the limits on water usage in the event of a drought.
            <br>-keep some extra water stocked in case of a medical emergency. If someone gets sick or injured, they'll need to drink more to stay hydrated. You also will need the water to clean any wounds.
            <br>-If a situation gets dire and drinking water is getting scarce, don't ration to the point of dehydration. Lost hikers have been found dying of dehydration when they still had water left because they were trying to conserve. Drink what you need to stay alive.
            <br>-Thousands of gallons of water fall on your property every year. Take advantage of this by harvesting some of it. You can stock this rainwater for drought-conditions by using it to water your lawn and cleaning. In the meantime, you can use it to take a good chunk out of your water bill. Installing one is easy.
            <br>-Check for and repair any leaks in your home.
